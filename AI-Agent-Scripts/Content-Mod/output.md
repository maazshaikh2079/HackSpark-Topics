Here's a fun IoT project! ðŸ‘‹ Using a servo motor and an IR sensor, I've built a system that triggers the servo to rotate 90 degrees when the IR sensor detects an object. Otherwise, it stays at 0 degrees. Simple but effective! #IoT #Arduino #ServoMotor #IRsensor #DIY #Electronics #Project

**Pointers to improve the post quality:**

*   **Add a visual:** A picture or, even better, a short video of the project in action would significantly increase engagement.
*   **Be more specific:** Briefly mention the application or use case of the project. What problem does it solve?
*   **Call to action:** Encourage interaction. Ask a question like, "What would you use this for?" or "Any ideas on how to improve it?"
*   **Link to resources (if applicable):** If you have a tutorial or code available, share the link.
*   **Mention the microcontroller:** Specify which microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi Pico) you used, as this is key for others to replicate the project.
*   **Tailor hashtags:** Use more specific hashtags related to the project details (e.g., if you're using an Arduino Uno, add #ArduinoUno).
*   **Consider your target audience:** Adapt the language and detail level based on who you are trying to reach with your post. A post aimed at other makers will be different from a post aimed at a general audience.
